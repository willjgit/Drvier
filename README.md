# Drvier
This is a Kernel driver which gives you the ability of reading and writing to memory from kernel.

# Advantages
- You can read or write to memory without creating a process
- Unlike csgo not every game gives you the chance to write to memory from User Mode, so you will need a driver
- More security for csgo cheats
- It sounds better than User Mode shit

# How To Use
- Build it then load it with your fav loader.

# TO DO 
- Add memory writing
- Better code
- User Mode App

# Note 
- Yes you still need an User Mode App because Driver will do the memory things and User Mode App will do the rest.
